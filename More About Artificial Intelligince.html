                In the twenty-first century, AI techniques have experienced a resurgence following concurrent advances in computer power, large amounts of data,
                 and theoretical understanding; and AI techniques have become an essential part of the technology industry, helping to solve many challenging problems in computer science, software engineering and operations research.</big></p>
